# Analyzing Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2017

## Installations
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib


## Project Motivation
Stack Overflow surveys a sizable number of its users annually about a wide range of topics, including coding style, salaries, programming languages, and other topics. They received more than 64,000 responses this year from 213 different countries. I want to investigate the insights in this dataset with a few queries.

- Which country has the largest survey respondent?
- Which professional has the largest number of respond of this survey?
- What is the average years of experience of all developer?
- Is there any relation between Education and Salary?

In order to provide the reader with an understanding of the questions addressed, I wanted the chance to examine the facts and share my conclusions.
